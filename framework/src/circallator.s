;;; Circulatory Allocator

;;; A very simple allocator which will allocate memory in a buffer
;	from beginning to the end and if the end is reached the allocator
;	starts to use the memory at the beginning. Advantage is that
;	you do not need to free memory. The disadvantage is that
;	allocating to much memory will produce strange behaviour or
;	the universe may come to an end. And beware of allocating more
;	bytes then there are available...
